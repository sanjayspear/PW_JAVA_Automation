QUESTION: Is my understanding correct that when we update a Maven dependency, we may encounter project-level 
		errors, and to resolve them, we can use goals like clean install, followed by updating the project?
		

ANSWER:

Yes, your understanding is correct. When updating Maven dependencies, it's common to encounter errors at the project level. In such cases, performing the following steps helps to resolve these issues:

	1. Run mvn clean install: This ensures that the project is rebuilt from scratch by cleaning out all previously 
	   compiled files and reinstalling dependencies. It resolves potential issues caused by stale or missing files[5].

	2. Update the project: In IDEs like Eclipse, you can then update the project to refresh the workspace and 
	   synchronize it with the latest dependencies[1].

This process generally resolves Maven-related dependency issues.


Question: What happens when the latest version of Playwright is available on the official website but not updated
          in the Maven repository?

Answer: When the latest version of Playwright is available on the official website but not updated in the Maven 
        repository, including that version as a dependency in your pom.xml can lead to project-level errors, such 
        as missing artifacts or unresolved dependencies. To resolve this, you should:

    1. Verify the latest version of Playwright in the Maven repository to ensure it is available.
    2. If the version is not updated, you can either wait for it to be available in the Maven repository 
       or manually add the necessary Playwright JAR files to your project.

This issue commonly arises when Maven repositories do not reflect updates as quickly as the official project site
